            "abstract": " The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) poses a major challenge for wildfire detection due to complex terrain and shifting risk patterns, where existing solutions (e.g., random, greedy, or genetic algorithms) often struggle at large scales or in dynamic conditions. This study introduces a dynamic, burn-probability-driven grid-based IoT sensor deployment strategy that adapts sensor placement to local fire risk distributions. Tested against random and greedy baselines in two geographically distinct Canadian regions—Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and Kelowna—our approach boosts detection rates by up to 35% over traditional methods, improving adaptability and efficiency in complex landscapes. By systematically integrating burn probability into sensor placement decisions, the proposed method offers a scalable, data-driven framework for IoT-based wildfire monitoring, supporting smart city resilience and adaptive risk management. Although this paper emphasizes spatial sensor deployment, future work should address cost optimization and routing strategies for dynamic sensor relocation to further enhance WUI wildfire detection.",

            "abstract": "Over time, after vegetation and forests burn, the natural growth of new vegetation and forest emerges. The newly grown vegetation in forests may act as fuel for potential future fires. Fuel type data is needed for the Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) system, which is a part of the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS). CWFIS, with the help of FBP, provides critical information on forest fires and wildfires across Canada. This study aims to apply data science to the fuel type data critical to the FBP system and derive reusable informational insights that can be used by future researchers. The study provides information at a provincial scale for the entire Canadian geographic boundary. Based on our analysis of the data, we revealed that remote sensing sources take at least a year to identify new vegetation. Further, this research investigates the regrowth of different fuel types over the years and identifies Ontario and Saskatchewan to be at a higher risk of reburn while Alberta and Quebec have a lower risk.",
