            "abstract": "This research provides a spatio-temporal agnostic framework based on subsampling to generate generic deep learning models using publicly available weather data and to predict the probability of forest fire and severity. The aim is to show that this framework can be used to subsample and generate a balanced dataset for generic deep learning models to improve predictions for forest fires. The framework works for binary classification and regression deep learning models. It also works with limited variations between fire and non-fire data. Using this framework, 45 of the binary classification models built produced an F1Score greater than 0.95 while 35 of 54 regression models produced an R 2 Score greater than 0.91.",

This research focuses on the effectiveness of multi-source data (lightning, hydrometric and weather) in the probability prediction of forest fires using deep learning. The results showed that the weather model had the best predictive power (average F1 Score = 0.955 F1 Score=0.955). The lightning model had an average F1 Score = 0.924 F1 Score=0.924, while the hydrometric model had an average F1 Score = 0.690 F1 Score=0.690. The single-source models were then merged to see the impact of the multi-source data. The multi-source model had an average F1 Score = 0.929 F1 Score = 0.929, whereas the average F1 Score for the previous three single-source model was 0.856. The results showed that the multi-source model performed similarly to the best-performing single-source model (weather) with a 60% reduction in training data. The multi-source model had a negligible impact from the poor-performing single-source model (hydrometric).",

However, machine learning use for forest fire ignition classification prediction within the platform and ones like it, is yet to be fully realized. We propose a novel framework that uses federated machine learning combined with Internet of Things technologies, for forest fire ignition classification prediction. The framework incorporates distributed IoT weather stations deployed in an area prone to forest fires. We find comparable prediction accuracy between a federated machine learning system and a central server machine learning system. Our federated system, trained on an imbalanced dataset comprising 5,008,365 non-ignition cases and 45,411 ignition instances, has shown encouraging outcomes. It attained an Accuracy of around 0.76 and a ROC-AUC of about 0.80. The performance is on par with other systems, indicating that our approach is effective in classifying forest fire ignitions with a spatial resolution markedly superior to that of centralized systems.",

This study employs machine learning techniques and builds a dataset framework utilizing Copernicus climate reanalysis data combined with historical fire data to develop a fire classification framework. Three algorithms, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, were evaluated. Given the pronounced class imbalance of 154:1 between “non-fire” and “fire” events, we rigorously employed two re-sampling strategies: Spatiotemporal, focusing on spatial and seasonal considerations, and Technique-Driven, leveraging advanced algorithmic approaches. Ultimately, XGBoost combined with NearMiss Version 3 in a 0.09 sampling ratio between non-fire and fire events yielded the best results: 98.08% precision, 86.06% sensitivity, and 93.03% specificity."

Data for forest fires is available from multiple sources and is huge. Federated learning can be implemented to distribute the computing across multiple edge devices by saving transmission costs, protecting data privacy, and maintaining security with no single point of failure as local models exist across multiple resources in different geographic regions. The proposed framework extends the Spatio-Temporal Agnostic Subsampling (STAS) technique by distributing the data into multiple computation nodes to leverage federated learning. It was found that the models trained using federated learning on weather data gained on average 0.3 in F1 for classifying the occurrence of fire. This study also demonstrates how to optimally choose the sources of data for either predicting the occurrence of fire or the severity of fire",

We evaluated even grid distribution, random distributions, and genetic algorithm-based methods, testing each against 50,000 burn maps with sensor counts ranging from 50 to 800. Results indicate that while even grid distribution achieved the highest detection rates, its practicality in real-world applications is limited. Genetic algorithms showed promise but require further exploration to simulate field deployment accurately. Notably, weighting sensor placement based on wildland fire growth risk did not significantly impact detection effectiveness, highlighting the need for further research into the representativeness of burn maps.",

This paper focuses on increasingly widespread forest fires, causing greater destruction in recent years. Data obtained from sensors for predicting forest fires and assessing fire severity, i.e., area burned, are multivariate, seasonal, and highly imbalanced with a ratio of 100,000+ non-fire events to 1 fire event. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal Agnostic Sampling (STAS) to overcome the challenge of highly imbalanced data. This paper first presents a mathematical understanding of fire and non-fire events and then a thorough complexity analysis of the proposed STAS framework and two existing methods, NearMiss and SMOTE. Further, to investigate the applicability of STAS, binary classification models (to determine the probability of forest fire) and regression models (to assess the severity of forest fire) were built on the data generated from STAS. A total of 432 experiments were conducted to validate the robustness of the STAS parameters. Additional experiments with a temporal data split were conducted to further validate the results. The results show that 180 of the 216 binary classification models had an 𝐹1𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒>0.9 and 150 of the 216 regression models had an 𝑅2𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒>0.75. These results indicate the applicability of STAS for fire prediction with highly imbalanced multivariate seasonal time series data.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire incidents have exhibited an alarming surge in frequency as well as severity in recent years highlighting the need for advanced technologies to predict wildfire behavior in advance and mitigate its impact. In recent years, the enormous strides in machine learning research coupled with the increased availability of wildfire data and computational resources have fueled the rise of data-driven approaches in wildfire management. The prediction of wildfire behavior over time, such as the burned area has been largely underexplored. This study aims to advance data-driven methods for predicting wildfire behavior during the active fire stage and aid in timely decision making and resource allocation efforts by adopting a Graph Neural Network based framework for predicting the burned area resulting from a wildfire ignition. While CNN-based architectures have been widely employed to model wildfire behaviour, these architectures impose specific limitations on geospatial data due to their reliance on fixed-size inputs and local receptive fields. Graph Neural Network (GNNs), have shown success in capturing the long-range dependencies and irregular-sized inputs inherent in geospatial data, such as wildfires, making them a viable alternative to CNNs. To this end, a GNN-based approach is adopted to model wildfire burned area prediction. The results obtained through various experiments illustrate the efficacy of Graph Neural Networks in modeling wildfire behavior by effectively capturing spatial dependencies.",

            "abstract": "Given the critical importance of timely forest fire detection to mitigate environmental and socio-economic consequences, this research aims to achieve high detection accuracy while maintaining real-time operational efficiency, with a particular focus on minimizing computational complexity. We propose a novel framework that systematically integrates normalization, feature selection, adaptive oversampling, and classifier optimization to enhance detection performance while minimizing computational overhead. The evaluation is conducted using three distinct Canadian forest fire datasets: Alberta Forest Fire (AFF), British Columbia Forest Fire (BCFF), and Saskatchewan Forest Fire (SFF). Initial classifier benchmarking identified the best-performing tree-based model, followed by normalization and feature selection optimization. Next, four oversampling methods were evaluated to address class imbalance. An ablation study quantified the contribution of each module to overall performance. Our targeted, stepwise strategy eliminated the need for exhaustive model searches, reducing computational cost by 97.75% without compromising accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in F1-score, AFF (from 69.12% to 82.75%), BCFF (61.95% to 77.91%), and SFF (90.03% to 96.18%) alongside notable reductions in False Negative Rates compared to baseline models.",
